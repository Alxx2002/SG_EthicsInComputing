# SG_EthicsInComputing
This is a public repository for the University of Utah College of Engineering class CS 3090-01, taught by Dr. Phillips during the Fall 2025 semester. 
It was originally created as part of the "Block 2 Project" assignment. 

The purpose of this repository is to contain, store, and share Sasha Groo's work for this class, as well as any other personal projects related to ethics in computing.
